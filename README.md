# Neural_Networks
SLC_LSTM ->        This is a code written for prediction of Power Consumed by the street Lamps by using a deeplearning methods.
                   In this code LSTM neural network is trained to predict the power consumption. 
slc_106_arima ->   This is a code written for prediction of Power Consumed by the street Lamps by using a deeplearning methods.
                   In this code a statistical model called ARIMA is used to predict the power consumption.      
nn_scratch_mnist-> This is a code written from scratch of a multilayered perceptron model which is trained on the MNIST dataset 
                   to predict which number is in the image.
