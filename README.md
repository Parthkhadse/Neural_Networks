**Power_Prediction_LSTM**        ->        This is a code written for prediction of Power Consumed by the street Lamps by using a deeplearning methods.
                              In this code LSTM neural network is trained to predict the power consumption. 
                              
**Power_Prediction_ARIMA**   ->        This is a code written for prediction of Power Consumed by the street Lamps by using a statistical model.
                              In this code a statistical model called ARIMA is used to predict the power consumption.    
                              
**nn_scratch_mnist**->        This is a code written from scratch of a multilayered perceptron model which is trained on the MNIST dataset 
                              to predict which number is in the image.
